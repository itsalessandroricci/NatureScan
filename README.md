# NatureScan

Welcome to **NatureScan**, an app designed for nature lovers. Using advanced machine learning, NatureScan identifies and classifies plants and animals from photos. Users can snap a picture to learn about species and explore detailed descriptions. The app works offline, making it perfect for mountain hikes.
